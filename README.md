## Repository Structure
- `spatial.pdf`: The pdf file of the original publication.
- `Ppt.pdf`: The powerpoint slides that was presented to the BCB546 class.
- `Figure2a-b_Annotation.ipynb`: Python script file that contains the python code used to generate Figure 2a and figure 2b.
- `Figure2a.png`: The bar plot generated using the strawberry data and python script. 
- `Figure2b.png`: The box plot generated using the strawberry data and python script.
- `Figure3_4 folder`: This directory contains the csv files used in the script named as "firstsheet.csv" and " second.csv". The script is stored as a python 3 jupyter notebook named "Figures3.4.ipynb". Finally, the generated figures are stored in the "Final_Figures" folder.
